### This is a website I made for my Computer Science Seminar course.

## Motivation Behind Pilots Eat

I created this website because I thought about how much college students love food and how it would be helpful to have an online forum where students could post their recommendations about what and where to eat on and around campus. The website would be exclusively for students, using the University of Portland's SSO authentication scheme to verify that a user is a student. Students could upvote and downvote posts based on their agreement which would influence the order that posts are displayed. The website would be useful for students who are looking to explore off-campus since there would be a page dedicated for off-campus dining. For students who are trying to spend less, the steals & deals section of the website would display the best priced and most popular items at the on-campus Mack's Market and at other grocery stores in the area.

## Development
The major reason why I chose to build a website for my professional development activity was because I wanted to familiarize myself with the AngularJS web framework which I will be using during my internship this summer. Angular is a component based framework which I took advantage of for the review posts on the website. Each post is its own component with properties (title, author, date, location, description, upvotes, downvotes). Using this component workflow made making changes to the website a lot easier. This is also the first website that I have hosted on Github pages. This was a fairly easy task to accomplish and I will definitely continue using Github pages in the future. Another important feature of this website is its mobile layout. I had to make sure that the navigation bar and the posts displayed in a way that was easy to understand and scroll through on all screens.

Because of the smaller scope of this project, the website is currently not functional in the sense that posts cannot be added and upvotes/downvotes are not saved. This would require a database and more backend work which I didn't want to dive into. Also, because I used high resolution JPG pictures from an iPhone for the pictures on the Food Reviews and Steals & Deals pages, they will likely load slowly.

This project helped me grow my knowledge of AngularJS and has made me more confident looking towards my internship this summer.
