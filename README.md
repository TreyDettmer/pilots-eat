## Motivation Behind Pilots Eat

I created this website because I thought about how much college students love food and how it would be helpful to have an online forum where students could post their reccomendations about what and where to eat on and around campus. The website would be exclusively for students, using the University of Portland's SSO authentication scheme to verify that a user is a student. Students could upvote and downvote posts based on their agreement which would influence the order that posts are displayed. The website would be useful for students who are looking to explore off-campus since there would be a page dedicated for off-campus dining. For students minding their wallet, the steals & deals section of the website would display the best priced and most popular items at the on-campus Mack's Market and at other grocery stores in the area.
